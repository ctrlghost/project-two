    <h2><u>Ahri</u></h2>
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</div>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Personality</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ahri is a vastaya with an innate connection to the magic of Runeterra, embodying both mystery and allure. 
    Born with the essence of a fox, she walks the line between predator and empath, able to manipulate emotions and steal the life 
    essence of her victims to absorb their memories. Though she once used this power freely, intoxicated by the rush of stolen experiences, 
    Ahri is now haunted by the guilt of lives lost at her hands. This inner conflict drives her to seek understanding of herself and the world
    around her without succumbing to her darker instincts. Intelligent, cunning, and irresistibly charming, she uses her abilities to navigate
     the complexities of human society while searching for meaning, redemption, and a sense of true belonging among those she once saw as prey.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay Overview</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ahri is a mobile, burst-damage mage/assassin best played in the <b>mid lane</b>. She excels at picking off vulnerable 
 targets with her crowd control and mobility. Her defining strengths include <b>safe waveclear</b>, <b>high pick potential</b>,
    and <b>tricky escapes</b> thanks to her ultimate. She’s often described as a "playmaking mage"—able to set up fights with
    Charm <b>(E)</b> or punish mispositioned enemies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, Ahri is <b>skill-shot reliant</b> missing Charm often means missing a kill. She has 
    mana management concerns early on and can be vulnerable to hard-engage or burst if she’s caught out of position. 
    In teamfights, she thrives on <b>skirmishes</b>, <b>flanks</b>, and <b>clean-up</b> rather than straight-up front-to-back fights.</p>
