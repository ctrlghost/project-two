    <h2><u>Jayce</u></h2>
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</div>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Personality</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jayce is a brilliant inventor and proud defender of
     Piltover, celebrated as a hero for his technological genius and unshakable
    commitment to progress. Confident—some might say arrogant—he believes deeply
    in protecting his city from any threat, no matter the cost. Though charming
    and charismatic, Jayce can be impulsive and dismissive of those he sees as
    obstacles to his vision of Piltover's future. He values results over caution,
    often clashing with colleagues who question his methods. At heart, Jayce is 
    driven by a genuine desire to safeguard Piltover’s ideals and people, even as 
    his uncompromising nature sometimes alienates those closest to him.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay Overview</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Jayce is a <b>top-lane (or sometimes mid-lane) fighter</b>
    known for his <b>versatile, lane-dominant playstyle</b> and ability to switch between
    melee and ranged forms. He excels at <b>bullying opponents early</b> with long-range poke
    and strong all-in potential, making him a lane bully who can snowball hard.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">His ranged Cannon Stance lets him poke safely and siege,
    while Hammer Stance offers burst damage and mobility for all-ins. Jayce rewards aggressive,
    precise play and strong understanding of trading windows. However, he’s vulnerable to being
    outscaled by tanky opponents if he falls behind, and lacks hard CC for teamfights beyond his knockback.</p>
