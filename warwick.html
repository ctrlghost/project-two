<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Personality</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Warwick is a monstrous, chemically altered predator who stalks the dark alleys of Zaun. 
    Once a man with a violent past he struggles to remember, he was transformed through agonizing experimentation into 
    a blood-hungry beast. Despite his brutal instincts and terrifying appearance, glimmers of his old humanity remain, 
    surfacing as fragmented memories and flashes of remorse. Haunted by what he’s become, Warwick channels his rage at 
    criminals and those who prey on the helpless, acting as a grim, unrelenting vigilante. Driven by bloodlust yet tormented 
    by guilt, he’s both predator and reluctant protector, embodying the raw, dangerous chaos of Zaun itself.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay Overview</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Warwick is a <b>jungler</b> known for <b>strong sustain, reliable ganks, 
    and fearsome dueling power</b>. He thrives at hunting low-health enemies thanks to his Blood Hunt, 
    making him a threat in extended skirmishes and 1v1s. His kit gives him excellent early-game clear 
    with built-in healing and makes him hard to duel in the river or jungle.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Warwick’s gameplay is straightforward but effective—he hunts
 weakened targets, uses his suppression ultimate for high-impact ganks, and serves as a disruptive
 frontline presence in teamfights. Though simple to learn, he rewards good map awareness and timing.
 His main weaknesses are reliance on engaging fights smartly (as he has no real escape) and being kited 
by ranged carries if he can’t close the gap.</p>
