    <h2><u>Senna</u></h2>
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</div>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Personality</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Senna is a resolute and compassionate sentinel who has spent much of her life 
    battling the supernatural forces of the Shadow Isles. Once cursed to be haunted by the Black Mist, she 
    was ultimately killed and trapped within it—only to return stronger than ever, wielding its darkness 
    as a weapon against itself. Senna is defined by her strength of will and unwavering sense of duty. 
    Though her life has been filled with pain, loss, and isolation, she carries herself with poise and wisdom,
    driven by the belief that no soul is beyond saving. She’s fiercely protective of others, particularly her 
    husband Lucian, and balances her somber past with hope for a brighter future.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Gameplay Overview</u></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Senna is a <b>support marksman</b> with a unique blend of <b>utility,
 scaling damage, and global impact</b>. She plays as a long-ranged enchanter/ADC hybrid who supports
  allies while dishing out surprising damage. Her passive allows her to scale infinitely by collecting
 Mist from souls, turning her into a late-game carry with strong poke and healing.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Senna thrives in drawn-out fights and poke-heavy comps. Her biggest
 strength lies in her <b>long-range harass, healing, and map-wide ultimate</b>, making her a valuable pick
 for coordinated play. However, she is <b>immobile</b>, has <b>slow attack speed</b>, and relies heavily on positioning
 and soul collection to hit her power spikes.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Abilities & Mechanics</u></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Passive – Absolution</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Senna collects Mist from enemy champions and souls, increasing her attack 
range, critical strike chance, and damage over time. Her auto-attacks take longer to fire but deal bonus
damage based on target HP.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>Q – Piercing Darkness</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Fires a beam through a target, damaging enemies and healing allies 
it passes through. Core poke and sustain tool.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>W – Last Embrace</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">A shadowy bolt that latches onto the first target and detonates 
after a short delay, rooting enemies in an area. Great for picks or disengage.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>E – Curse of the Black Mist</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Shrouds Senna and nearby allies in camouflage and movement speed, 
making them untargetable unless revealed. Ideal for repositioning or surprise engages.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>R – Dawning Shadow</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Fires a massive global beam that shields allies it hits and damages
 enemies in the center. Strong for turning fights or aiding distant skirmishes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Basic Combo:</u></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Auto + Q for poke > W to set up root > E to reposition or disengage > R for global impact.</p>
